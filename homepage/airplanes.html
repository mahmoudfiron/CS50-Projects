During missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes (Mach 3.2 and 85,000 ft; 26,000 m), allowing it to evade or outrace threats. If a surface-to-air missile launch was detected, the standard evasive action was to accelerate and outpace the missile.</p>

                                    <p>The first prototype flew in 1964 and the aircraft entered service in 1970. Although it was capable of reaching Mach 3.2+, this would result in the engines accelerating out of control and needing replacement, therefore the operational top speed was limited to Mach 2.83. The MiG-25 features a powerful radar and four air-to-air missiles, and it still has the world record for reached altitude of 38 km (125,000 ft).</p>

                <h2>What I like about them</h2>
                <p>Few things are as interesting as machines that allow man to fly.</p>
                <p>The fact that human ingenuity allows for something as absurd as searing through the heavens as a bird would, is just incomparable to anything else for me.</p>
                <p>Particularly intriguing are military aircraft; as they're built for military purposes, programs intended to make them receive insanely high budgets, and so engineers can really go all out on the technology.</p>
                <p>All of them are interesting in different ways, but a few of them stand out for me; above this text you can see a slideshow with their pictures.</p>
